i want to change my direction here. so far with your help i have used my account statement to build this system, where i
can categorize and analyze my debits as well as credits. i use credit card as well and rather than using my account statement
I instead want to consume my credit card statement via this tool that we are building. same stack - lets stick to java only for now.
This is helping me to learn. we will move to spring or spring batch later. Attached is my credit card statement. What i expect from
this system it should categorize my spends based on configurable rules. Can we use the same low level design - load the statement in database,
identify the statement structure, insert transactions based on identified structure and then categorize spends. Can we use the same tables?
What else can be reused? Attached is my credit card statement.
