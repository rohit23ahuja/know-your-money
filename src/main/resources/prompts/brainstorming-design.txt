i am a java developer. i am building a tool for myself that will help reinforce my learnings in java, spring and spring
batch framework as well as help organising my finances. Tool is supposed to read my monthly account statement. dump the
data in database. identify the transaction data from the file. then gives me a summary of my monthly spends like how much
i did spent on various categories like food, commute, health expenses etc.

i have built the layer that takes my monthly account statement in xls format and dumps the data in database. this layer
populates the below two tables :-
CREATE TABLE statement_file
(
    id                BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bank_code         VARCHAR(20)  NOT NULL,
    account_number    VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,
    original_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at       TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE TABLE statement_cell
(
    id                BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    statement_file_id BIGINT       NOT NULL
        REFERENCES statement_file (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    row_index         INTEGER      NOT NULL,
    col_index         INTEGER      NOT NULL,
    cell_ref          VARCHAR(10)  NOT NULL,
    raw_value_text    TEXT NULL,
    created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

Design this system after this point.
